Defence Expenditures of NATO members as a percent of GDP
This project presents an interactive analysis of defence expenditures among NATO member countries.
The dashboard visualizes contributions as a share of GDP on an annual basis.
For over seven decades, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been a cornerstone of international peace and stability.
In an increasingly complex global security environment, shared defence investments are critical to maintaining readiness, interoperability, and collective resilience.
By examining expenditure patterns, this dashboard highlights how nations balance fiscal priorities with the collective responsibility of maintaining security within the alliance.
